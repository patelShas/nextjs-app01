# First Post

Hey! This is going to be the first post on the blog section of this website. As the first it would be most fitting to discuss the development of this site. Since the site is very much in-progress, its hard to make statements. So, I'll direct you to [this](https://github.com/patelShas/nextjs-app01/blob/main/NotesToSelf%26Changelog.md) file on the site's github. Initially the project's README, I began using it to record notes to myself about what I'd changes and what I need to add next. In a sense it doubles as a changelog. You can take a look at it to get a sense of how development has been going over time.
