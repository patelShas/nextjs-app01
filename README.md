your last action item was trying to make the custom themes work on this.
you set them up on globals.css, but page.tsx dowsn't seem to recognize them

you got it done by writing them in tailwind.config.ts. next steps are to put this onto github, and to start nailing down exactly what items you want. CSS is nitty gritty you can do later
