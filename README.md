your last action item was trying to make the custom themes work on this.
you set them up on globals.css, but page.tsx dowsn't seem to recognize them

you got it done by writing them in tailwind.config.ts. next steps are to put this onto github, and to start nailing down exactly what items you want. CSS is nitty gritty you can do later

now your next trouble is getting positioning write. This feels like a rabbit whole, so if this problem continues, just through the styling and do something really basic. Getting the pages up is more important than making them look pretyy
